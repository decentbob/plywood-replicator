State on 2026-10-06 (after autorun run 20261006-0621, build). Read AGENTS.md first (rules of work), then this file.
History: docs/INNOVATIONS.md (newest first), RULES (Core changes), the autorun log and git (earlier handoffs: NEXT.md
at each run's merge: run 0450's at `b61a14e`, run 0251's at `f7b31f3`, run 0021's at `c98bb3c`, run 2320's at `5850fe7`, run 1921's at `908502a`, run 1850's at `f1ec517`, run 1422's at `4f65d5c`, with the condensed Direction of run 0751; that Direction in full at `a2f3914`).

**The goal changed (user, 2026-10-05): complex evolution** (AGENTS.md, IDEAS); the organism is a direction. The
user approved the order in "Direction (user)" below during run 0321. Run 1850 keeps that order and changes the vehicle
it is tried on (below).

**Handoff status (autorun run 20261006-0621, build).** **A pair world that keeps evolving** (priority 6 done;
INNOVATIONS run 0621, IDEAS "Deaths that return blanks"). New labelled drive on demo `pair`, off by default (default
output byte for byte the same): `PAHB=2`, every lysed triangle returns as a copy blank once free (`PAHB=1`: only the one
the hazard hits). With the mutagen the demo ends with an `evolving:` line. Findings (m 0.01, hazard per triangle 0.6,
decay 1):
1. Without the drive binding variants lock the material (seeds 1, 3, 4 at 300k: copies 371-4420 per 5000 steps).
   With `PAHB=2` copying stays at 15-28k per 5000 at 200k in 4 of 4 worlds, and new variant types still sweep after
   100k (4-10 per world). Copies equal deaths in a steady state, so binding cannot stop the flow.
2. The slice's second bar, free blanks above about 100, is met in 1 of the 3 small worlds alive at 300k (34-150):
   I judge it the wrong measure (the winners draw blanks lowest, as in resource competition; IDEAS), copies are.
3. Small worlds (100-250 bodies) can die out: seed 1 at 260k after a selfish S swept (a seed site with a lysis mark
   kills buds that bind it, so it is free and copied more); `PAHB=1` lost 2 of 4. In a 3x world (`PAB=3000 PAS=87`)
   4 of 4 lived to 300k with kinds still sweeping late; one-type replicators (a part that buds its own kind, `Y@&b@y`)
   evolved in 2 of 4. To 10^6 steps (3x world): 4 of 4 alive, copies
   53-73k per 5000; by 500k every world is one-type chains and rosettes whose variants keep replacing one another (3-8
   common types first seen after 500k), but no world grows more complex (no two-type kind returns). Nothing is running.
Checks: new `pair-flow` 4/4, `pair-flow-c` 2/2 (control); `check.js` now creates the `CHECK_SAVE` directory. `node
tri/test.js` 40 pass. The full suite was not rerun (only demo `pair` and `check.js` changed; default pair output
unchanged). Picture `pair-flow.png` (a one-off script from the `pop:`/`mut:` lines, not kept). Regenerate:
`PAHB=2 PAB=1000 PAS=50 PAP=5000 PAHT=1000 PAH=0.6 PAD=1 PAM=0.01 PAHU=1 node tri/demos.js pair SEED 300000 runs`
(about 4 minutes; without `PAHB` the baseline).

**Next step (rotation 53, cleanup).** Prune what the pair world no longer needs: `budcycle`'s dead option variables
(Direction item 6 below: `BCLK`, `BCH`, `BCHT`, `BCP`, `BCW`, `BCO`, `BCSV`, `BCGATE`) once nothing cites them as
working; consider retiring `pair-mut` (its evidence is within `pair-flow`'s worlds) and keep the full suite green.
Then (54, build) Direction 3 on the flowing world: two kinds on one supply; and (55, explore) heredity of
combinations, which the selfish-S extinction shows is now the limit (selection sees part types, not bodies).

### Direction (review-intent run 20261005-1850)
The argument is in IDEAS ("Sources in proportion to use"); in short:
1. **The front sink is structural.** A part type is made where its free sides are exposed. In the 47-type kind that is
   growth fronts (type k exposed while the front waits for k+1) and, with open walls, only the outward half of a
   one-row ring (the inward half faces the lumen). Exposure differs from type to type, and with 47 unique types in one
   pool the least exposed type sets the rate. Runs 0721, 1051 and 1422 each closed one sink and found the next; no
   drive can make unequal sources equal.
2. **Design rule: every cell of a complete body exposes exactly one copyable side to the outside.** Each living body is
   then one source of each of its types, so types are made in the proportion buds use them, by symmetry, with no need
   signal (run 1422's option (c), met by geometry). The same rule is what heredity needs: a variant part is made in
   proportion to the bodies that carry it. A one-row ring with a lumen cannot meet it, nor a filled hexagon (its root's
   one outer side is the joint, spent after the split). A strip can: its end cells have two free sides.
3. **The pair:** root R `Y@&` `b@` `-` and second cell S `B@` `y` `-|` (side order chosen so a bud points away from its
   parent; as built in run 2320: R `Y@&b@|-`, S `B@-y|`, IDEAS "Built"). A free R binds a body's seed site `y`; its open `b@` emits; a free S binds there; R hears nothing (openRange
   1 suffices: R is the emitter) and its `&` lets go. Rules used: `@` binding, contact copying, the open signal, `&`
   release. No new rule. R is exposed by its `-` side, S by `y` (while no bud sits on it).
4. **Why switch now** (AGENTS: mechanisms in isolation, then combined): on the pair none of the three interacting sinks
   (strands, fronts, lumen) exists, a generation should take thousands of steps instead of about 300 thousand, and a
   variant changes one of two types, so Directions 2 and 3 become measurable. If the pair cannot run on with labelled
   drives, no larger kind will; if it can, the rule and the drive rates carry over. Risk, stated: in template worlds the
   smallest fastest replicator usually wins; what could pay for a longer kind here (predation by `!` outer sides,
   protection, crowding) is Direction 3's question, and it is the research.
5. **Not taken:** run 1422's (b), parts made where they are next used, needs complementary contact copying (a core
   change) and turns growth into crystal growth. (a), few periodic types in a ring, helps only linearly and keeps the
   lumen; a periodic ring comes back later as a compartment on the evolution vehicle.
6. **Housekeeping found:** `budcycle` carries about 20 option variables, many from dead ends (`BCLK`, `BCH`, `BCHT`,
   `BCP`, `BCW`, `BCO`, `BCSV`, `BCGATE`): prune at the next cleanup, after the pair world has taken the drives it reuses.
   Since run 0751 the core grew by one rule (lysis: a capability) and one option (`heldContact`: none); fine.

**Priorities (each a slice; rotation index in brackets).**
1. Done in run 1921 (core-review): `heldContact` removed; (o) closed without a change; busy and refractory removed.
2. Done in run 2320 (build): the pair in isolation (`pairKit` R `Y@&b@|-`, S `B@-y|`; demo `pair`; checks `pair`,
   `pair-c`). Buds point away; no jam seen (a parent buds again once its last bud has moved off: children per body
   0.99 on average, founder 4, at most 7, while blanks lasted; seed 1).
3. Done in run 0021 (harden): speed for pair worlds, 1.8-2.1x, exact.
4. Done in run 0251 (build): Direction 1 on the pair (`PAH` 0.6, `PAD` 1: 4 of 4 worlds to 10^6 steps; check `pair-run`).
5. Done in run 0450 (explore): Direction 2, heritable variation and selection with a labelled mutagen (no core change;
   candidate (r), copy error, not needed yet).
6. Done in run 0621 (build): a world that keeps evolving (deaths return blanks, `PAHB=2`; check `pair-flow`).
7. [54 build] **Direction 3:** two kinds on one supply (the pair and a 3-cell strip, or kinds the mutagen made): who
   wins, and why. [55 explore] heredity of combinations: a body's parts come mostly from its own copies (IDEAS).
8. Frozen: the 47-type organism (feeding, (n), the front sink, lysis in the lineage); it returns as the complex end once
   the pair world runs on and varies.

**Rotation (autorun `projects/plywood/rotation.txt`): unchanged**; its mix (5 build, 3 explore, 1 harden, 1 cleanup, 1
review-intent, 1 core-review per 12) fits a new vehicle that needs mostly building. 52 build, 53 cleanup, 54 build, 55 explore, 56 build,
57 explore, 58 review-intent, 59 core-review.

### Direction (user, 2026-10-05, approved during run 20261005-0321): complex evolution first
The goal is complex evolution (AGENTS.md, IDEAS 2026-10-05); the organism that feeds its bud is a direction, not the
finish line. The user approved this order for the next slices:
1. **A world that runs indefinitely:** material returns to blanks under conservation, with a steady, labelled
   environment drive. On the 47-type kind: food stock spent (0321), blanks in leaked strands (0721), scavengers cannot
   track the population (1051), blanks at stalled fronts (1422). Next: on the pair (priority 4 above).
2. **The simplest heritable variation:** e.g. contact copying that now and then makes a different part type, the
   variant itself copied true (heredity with mutation in one rule; a core change: make the case in RULES first).
3. **A minimal competition test:** two variants on one food supply; does one win, and for a reason?

**Core-change candidates (for the next `core-review` or `explore`).**
- (s) *Lysed material returns as blanks* (run 0621): the labelled drive `PAHB=2` as physics (a lysed triangle that comes
  free becomes a copy blank, replacing "returns to a fresh state of its type"). Not needed while the drive does it; it
  would make every death return raw material, and lysis stop recycling parts (the lysis demo's bud regrows from them).
- (r) *Copy error in contact copying* (run 0450): not needed yet; a labelled mutagen on free parts gives the same
  variants (RULES, Core changes). Open: whether the core or the environment should limit parts that bind their own
  kind (`g@` and `G@` on one part), which lock the material in the mutagen world.
- Closed in run 1921: (p) removed (git `4f65d5c`); (o) not adopted: the oracle `LYFIX` never fades and is removed, a
  fading variant ("a partner bonded since the last pass counts as open one bond away") left false releases at 8, 0, 2,
  14 (base 8, 0, 2, 13). Before any new fix for (o), trace one `falseRel` in `budcycle-lysis` seed 4. Done: (q) busy
  and refractory removed (RULES, Core changes).
- (n) *Bud only after letting go* (run 1721): a seed site binds a root only while its triangle hears no open signal
  (oracle `BCGATE=1`). Organism lineage; frozen with it.
- (j) *Monomer mix* (run 0022) and (l) *a copy side with a glued anchor side* (run 0820): no design, no such type.
- Settled, keep: (f) the seed site `y` is copied while no bud sits on it (the pair relies on it). Not needed: (k).
  Done: (e), (i), (m) first step (lysis). Nothing else in the core is unused (RULES, Core inventory).

### Open follow-ups (not priorities; take when a run's kind fits)
- **Core review:** same-pass partner reads (zip, gap, release, fn) are allowed by convention (RULES, Locality audit);
  change only if a locality problem traces back to them. Coverage hook: `COV_OUT=$PWD/runs/cov.jsonl NODE_OPTIONS="-r
  ./tri/coverage.js" node tri/check.js` (one JSON line per demo world: marks present, rule events). To show a change
  leaves outputs the same: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/a node tri/check.js` before and after (another worktree), then
  `diff -r runs/a runs/b`.
- **Speed side note (run 1721):** a supply drive that keeps its stock outside the world, about 1.6x early in a run,
  changes outputs; decide it in a `build` that changes the setup.
- **Bigger cells and letter reuse** (user, 2026-10-03; IDEAS): R 5 is the largest all-unique kind (46 letters); if
  a slice needs a larger cell, reuse letters inside sealed compartments.

Older demos: `copy` (chain copying, the founder held by its high end) and `ring` (a ring kit closes); each check in
`tri/check.js` names its seeds, steps and extra. Commands of earlier setups are in their INNOVATIONS entries (options
since removed: in git at the commit each entry or `tri/demos.js` names). Pictures go to `runs/NAME.png` with saved
states; `TRI_NOPIC=1` turns them off. `TRI_RESUME=runs/x/NAME_tNNN.json.gz` continues a demo world from a saved state;
`TRI_PARAMS='{...}'` overrides parameters.

## Pitfalls learned
Read before designing a layout: docs/IDEAS.md, "Pitfalls learned (copy lineage)" (doorways, anchors, food sinks,
signals, rings, physics) and "Pitfalls from the casting lineage" (kits, pockets, doors, flaps; that lineage is
removed, its lessons stay).
