# Next instance: start here

State on 2026-10-07 (after autorun run 20261007-1921, explore). Read AGENTS.md first (rules of work), then this file.
History: docs/INNOVATIONS.md (newest first), RULES (Core changes), the autorun log, and git: each run's handoff is
this file at its merge (`git log -p docs/NEXT.md`); the review-intent Direction of run 0751 in full at `a2f3914`, the
pair Direction of run 1850 in full at `20e9a88`.

**Goal (user, 2026-10-05): complex evolution** (AGENTS.md, IDEAS); the organism that feeds its bud is a direction.
Since review-intent run 1850 the vehicle is **the pair** (2 cells, 2 types; IDEAS "Sources in proportion to use"): a
kind where every cell of a body exposes exactly one copyable side, so part types are made in the proportion buds use
them. The 47-type organism lineage is frozen; it returns as the complex end once the pair world varies and competes.

**Handoff status (autorun run 20261007-1921, explore).** Priority 20 tried (INNOVATIONS run 1921, IDEAS "A rare class
wastes its parts"); no rule change: candidate (t) built as an option, `copyGlue` (default off; RULES Core changes, with
its result: not adopted, kept for the core review to remove unless a slice uses it); demo `pair` gained `PAHB=3` (dead
triangles return as blanks that keep their glues) and `PADL` (lettered blanks lose their letters). **Private recycling
is not a resource:** with (t) and `PAHB=3` a class can be copied only from its own dead material, but it makes that
material from plain blanks, so nothing enters it from outside and the R* argument still holds: two equal private
classes exclude each other by 15-30k as fast as with (t) off (0 of 16 worlds with both at 80k, two designs), and an
in-place head's lettered blanks pile up at the one template a bud usually covers (the world dies, 4 of 4, without
`PADL`). **A rare class wastes its parts:** two equal blank farmers that each catch only second cells they make hold
150-200 each for about 10k, then one falls to under 15 within 5k (20 of 20 worlds with part decay 0.1-1, faster when
the pool is stirred); without decay both remain at 80k in 3 of 4. The rarer class's free parts decay or drift off
before its few waiting buds catch them: an Allee effect, which also explains run 1821's private-crop farmer (never
held, held when first). New checks `rare-waste` (4 of 4) and `rare-waste-c` (pass). The run's worlds are not kept
(regenerate: INNOVATIONS run 1921, Commands; about 2.5 minutes per 80k world with 4 at once). Nothing is running.

**Next step (rotation 70, review-intent).** A direction check after priorities 17-20: the web census holds at most the
limiting resources (run 1821), and new classes that catch only their own parts cannot invade (run 1921). Candidates for
the next build or explore: a class that invades on parts others make (a by-product of one class that another catches,
the farmer limited by something other than blanks), or delivery without a pool. The next core review should remove
`copyGlue` unless a slice has used it.

## Direction and priorities

The user approved this order (run 0321): (1) a world that runs indefinitely under conservation with steady, labelled
drives; (2) the simplest heritable variation; (3) a minimal competition test (two variants on one supply: does one
win, and for a reason?). On the pair, done (run; checks; INNOVATIONS has each): 1 the pair in isolation (2320; `pair`,
`pair-c`), its speed (0021); 2 hazard and decay drives (0251; `pair-run`); 3 variation and selection under a labelled
mutagen (0450; `pair-sel`); 4 deaths return blanks, a world that keeps evolving (0621; `pair-flow`); 5 budcycle's dead
options pruned (0920); 6 two kinds on one supply: the pair beats a 3-cell strip (1150; `duo`, `duo-inv`); 7 heredity
of combinations by locality, s about 0.44-0.58 (1322; `pair-host`); 8 a stock pays for length when risk is per
individual (1620; `duo-stock`); 9 heritable diets (1750; `diets`); 10 one openRange for every length (1920;
`strips`); 11 length by mutation shrinks to the 2-cell shortcut (2350; `ladder`, a negative); 12 the census of
individuals (0050); 13 the standard world `PAW=1` (0420; `world`); 14 host and catcher, what place delivers, the
4-cell arc (0622; `catcher-free`, `diets-catcher`, `arc-root`); 15 the recognition web does not grow; at 3x the
standard world collapses into heads that never let go (3 of 4), the whole-body hazard `PAHU=3` holds (4 of 4) (0820;
`web-two`); 16 the pair demo's options pruned (1051); 17 the whole-body hazard at h 0.07 is the standard world's
(1351; `world`, `arc-root` pins `PAHU=2`); 18 a class that owns its seed letter: in place, on a site-free stock;
it does not make the web grow (1720; `own-letter`); 19 kinds as food: every catcher farms its catch from blanks, so
the classes are at most the limiting resources, three on three (1821; `web-three`); 20 a resource each class makes for
itself: private recycling under (t) is no resource, and a rare class wastes its parts (1921; `rare-waste`). Open:
21. [70 review-intent, then 72 build] Candidates: a class that invades on parts others make (a by-product one class makes
    and another catches), deaths that return parts (`PAHB` off for one class's material), a kind that pays for length
    through cheaper catches (IDEAS run 0622), a longer kind whose function is in what binds.
Frozen: the 47-type organism (feeding, candidate (n), the front sink, lysis in the lineage). Not taken from run 1750's
list: (b) diets of different length and (c) more diets than blanks (run 1150's R* rule again).

Rotation (autorun `projects/plywood/rotation.txt`), unchanged (review-intent run 1851: the mix fits the order above):
70 review-intent, 71 core-review, 72 build, 73 harden, 74 build, 75 explore, 76 build, 77 cleanup.

**Core-change candidates (for the next `core-review` or `explore`).**
- (t) *A copy side reads glue* (run 1620): a copy side with a glue binds only a side carrying the complementary glue; an
  inert copy side binds any side, as now (every existing blank is inert, so outputs stay the same). Reads the partner
  side's glue (fixed type): local. It would let a second blank type be one kind's own resource (blanks `k?k?k?` copy only
  sides `K`), so a diet could be a copied side rather than a stock. Not needed while stock parts give a private resource
  (`PAF`); weigh it if a stock proves too special (it is a prepared supply of a kind's own part types).
  Run 1821: the classes are at most the limiting resources and every copied part is a blank, so (t) is the one way in the
  core to a resource kinds make; open: what keeps the second blank type in supply (`PAHB=2` returns plain blanks).
  Run 1921: **built as the option `copyGlue`** (default off) with the drive `PAHB=3` (lettered blanks): a class copied
  only from its own deaths, which is no resource (it makes them from plain blanks); exclusion as without it. Remove at
  the next core review unless a slice uses it.
- (s) *Lysed material returns as blanks* (run 0621): the labelled drive `PAHB=2` as physics (a lysed triangle that comes
  free becomes a copy blank, replacing "returns to a fresh state of its type"). Not needed while the drive does it; it
  would make every death return raw material, and lysis stop recycling parts (the lysis demo's bud regrows from them).
- (r) *Copy error in contact copying* (run 0450): not needed yet; a labelled mutagen on free parts gives the same
  variants (RULES, Core changes). Open: whether the core or the environment should limit parts that bind their own
  kind (`g@` and `G@` on one part), which lock the material in the mutagen world.
- (o) the open relay's one-pass lag: **adopted** in run 1920 together with the joint (RULES Core changes); the
  lineage's false releases (`falseRel`) did not change and have another cause (trace one before any fix).
- (n) *Bud only after letting go* (run 1721): its oracle `BCGATE` was removed in run 0920 (git `20e9a88`). Organism
  lineage; frozen with it.
- (j) *Monomer mix* (run 0022) and (l) *a copy side with a glued anchor side* (run 0820): no design, no such type.
- Settled, keep: (f) the seed site `y` is copied while no bud sits on it (the pair relies on it). Not needed: (k).
  Done: (e), (i), (m) first step (lysis), (p) and (q) removed in run 1921. Nothing else in the core is unused (RULES,
  Core inventory).

**Open follow-ups (not priorities; take when a run's kind fits).**
- Core review: same-pass partner reads (zip, gap, release, fn) are allowed by convention (RULES, Locality audit);
  change only if a locality problem traces back to them.
- Speed (run 1721): a supply drive that keeps its stock outside the world, about 1.6x early in a run, changes
  outputs; decide it in a `build` that changes the setup.
- Suite time (run 0920): the frozen lineage's two checks are about three quarters of the suite's CPU time; a `harden`
  or `review-intent` run may cut them to fewer seeds or shorter worlds while the lineage stays frozen.
- Bigger cells and letter reuse (user, 2026-10-03; IDEAS): R 5 is the largest all-unique kind (46 letters); if a
  slice needs a larger cell, reuse letters inside sealed compartments.

Older demos: `copy` (chain copying, the founder held by its high end) and `ring` (a ring kit closes); each check in
`tri/check.js` names its seeds, steps, extra and env, and each demo's options are listed in the comment above it in
`tri/demos.js`. Commands of earlier setups are in their INNOVATIONS entries (options since removed: in git at the
commit INNOVATIONS' header or `tri/demos.js` names). Pictures go to `runs/NAME.png` with saved states; `TRI_NOPIC=1`
turns them off. `TRI_RESUME=runs/x/NAME_tNNN.json.gz` continues a demo world from a saved state; `TRI_PARAMS='{...}'`
overrides parameters. To show a change leaves outputs the same: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/a node tri/check.js` in a
worktree of main and `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/b ...` in the branch, then `diff -r`. Coverage hook: `COV_OUT=$PWD/runs/cov.jsonl
NODE_OPTIONS="-r ./tri/coverage.js" node tri/check.js` (one JSON line per demo world: marks present, rule events).

## Pitfalls learned
Read before designing a layout: docs/IDEAS.md, "Pitfalls learned (copy lineage)" (doorways, anchors, food sinks,
signals, rings, physics) and "Pitfalls from the casting lineage" (kits, pockets, doors, flaps; that lineage is
removed, its lessons stay).
