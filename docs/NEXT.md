State on 2026-10-07 (after autorun run 20261007-1051, cleanup). Read AGENTS.md first (rules of work), then this file.
History: docs/INNOVATIONS.md (newest first), RULES (Core changes), the autorun log, and git: each run's handoff is
this file at its merge (`git log -p docs/NEXT.md`); the review-intent Direction of run 0751 in full at `a2f3914`, the
pair Direction of run 1850 in full at `20e9a88`.

**Goal (user, 2026-10-05): complex evolution** (AGENTS.md, IDEAS); the organism that feeds its bud is a direction.
Since review-intent run 1850 the vehicle is **the pair** (2 cells, 2 types; IDEAS "Sources in proportion to use"): a
kind where every cell of a body exposes exactly one copyable side, so part types are made in the proportion buds use
them. The 47-type organism lineage is frozen; it returns as the complex end once the pair world varies and competes.

**Handoff status (autorun run 20261007-1051, cleanup).** Priority 16 done, no capability or rule change (INNOVATIONS
run 1051). Every pair and strip check (34, 117 worlds) passes and prints byte for byte main's output, apart from the
parasite worlds' `par:` and `parental:` lines, which lost their always-zero selfish columns. New `tri/batch.js`: a
batch of demo worlds from a JSON file, at most 4 processes, an output file and picture directory per world (no shell
quoting of glue strings). NEXT, ROADMAP's backlog A: done priorities condensed. Nothing is running.

**Current slice (autorun run 20261007-1351, build; priority 17).** Goal: decide whether the whole-body hazard
(`PAHU=3`) becomes the standard world's hazard. Runs: (a) 3x `PAHU=2` calibration, seed 1, h 0.15/0.2/0.3/0.4 to 75k
(`runs/cal.json`), to find the h whose individuals match `PAHU=3` at 0.1 (500-700); (b) 3x `PAHU=2` at that h, seeds
1-4, 240k: does it collapse like h 0.1 (3 of 4)? (c) 1x `PAW=1 PAHU=3` seeds 1-4, 240k. Done when: if `PAHU=3` holds at
1x and 3x and the matched `PAHU=2` collapses, `PAW=1` uses `PAHU=3` and every `PAW=1` check is rerun (world, catcher-free,
arc-root, web-two, with controls), changed outcomes explained; otherwise the records say which explanation (harsher
hazard or whole body) holds and `PAW=1` stays. **Running (14:10 UTC):** (a) done: at 3x `PAHU=2` h 0.3 and 0.4 die
by 10k, h 0.2 holds 150-250 individuals, h 0.15 holds 530-720 from 20k to 60k (the match). (b) `node tri/batch.js
runs/m3.json` (3x, `PAHU=2 PAH=0.15`, seeds 1-4, 240k; the file is the 3x command's env plus those two, job id `m`). (b) done: seed 1 lost every complete individual by 210k (427-843 growing chains), seed 4 fell to
10 (699 chains, 28 blanks), seed 3 chains from 195k (205 at 240k), seed 2 held (530-690). (c) running (15:02 UTC):
`node tri/batch.js runs/w3.json` (1x `PAW=1 PAHU=3`, seeds 1-4, 240k, job id `w`). Prediction: the matched `PAHU=2` still collapses in at least 2 of 4
(chains split when one head is hit, so a harsher hazard per head does not stop them growing).

**Next step (rotation 66, build): priority 17**, the whole-body hazard at 1x and matched (below). The previous run's
3x worlds are not kept; regenerate with the 3x command below (about 70 minutes each, `PAHU=3` for the whole body), or
as a batch: `tri/batch.js` with `{"demo":"pair","steps":240000,"env":{"PAW":"1","PAB":"3000","PAS":"87","PAF":"C@-|z|:450
E@-|z|:450 G@-|z|:450","PAHU":"3"},"jobs":[{"id":"y3","seeds":[1,2,3,4]}]}`.

## Direction and priorities

The user approved this order (run 0321): (1) a world that runs indefinitely under conservation with steady, labelled
drives; (2) the simplest heritable variation; (3) a minimal competition test (two variants on one supply: does one
win, and for a reason?). On the pair, done (run; checks; INNOVATIONS has each): 1 the pair in isolation (2320; `pair`,
`pair-c`), its speed (0021); 2 hazard and decay drives (0251; `pair-run`); 3 variation and selection under a labelled
mutagen (0450; `pair-sel`); 4 deaths return blanks, a world that keeps evolving (0621; `pair-flow`); 5 budcycle's dead
options pruned (0920); 6 two kinds on one supply: the pair beats a 3-cell strip (1150; `duo`, `duo-inv`); 7 heredity
of combinations by locality, s about 0.44-0.58 (1322; `pair-host`); 8 a stock pays for length when risk is per
individual (1620; `duo-stock`); 9 heritable diets (1750; `diets`); 10 one openRange for every length (1920;
`strips`); 11 length by mutation shrinks to the 2-cell shortcut (2350; `ladder`, a negative); 12 the census of
individuals (0050); 13 the standard world `PAW=1` (0420; `world`); 14 host and catcher, what place delivers, the
4-cell arc (0622; `catcher-free`, `diets-catcher`, `arc-root`); 15 the recognition web does not grow; at 3x the
standard world collapses into heads that never let go (3 of 4), the whole-body hazard `PAHU=3` holds (4 of 4) (0820;
`web-two`); 16 the pair demo's options pruned (1051). Open:
17. [66 build] **The whole-body hazard at 1x and matched.** `world` with `PAHU=3` (seeds 1-4, 120k and 240k), and at 3x
    `PAHU=2` at a higher h that leaves as many individuals as `PAHU=3` at 0.1 (about 500-700): does the matched hazard
    per individual still collapse? If `PAHU=3` holds at 1x and 3x and the matched one does not, make it the standard
    world's hazard (`PAW=1`; every check that uses `PAW=1` rerun, changed outcomes explained). Cheats then outnumber
    hosts: say whether the web census still reads classes.
18. [67 explore] Candidates: a class that owns its seed letter (a host whose head carries its own seed site, as the B
    host at 3x seed 3; or a stock part with a private seed letter), a kind that pays for length through cheaper catches
    (IDEAS run 0622), a longer kind whose function is in what binds, or (t).
Frozen: the 47-type organism (feeding, candidate (n), the front sink, lysis in the lineage). Not taken from run 1750's
list: (b) diets of different length and (c) more diets than blanks (run 1150's R* rule again).

Rotation (autorun `projects/plywood/rotation.txt`), unchanged (review-intent run 1851: the mix fits the order above):
66 build, 67 explore, 68 build, 69 explore, 70 review-intent, 71 core-review, 72 build, 73 harden.

**Core-change candidates (for the next `core-review` or `explore`).**
- (t) *A copy side reads glue* (run 1620): a copy side with a glue binds only a side carrying the complementary glue; an
  inert copy side binds any side, as now (every existing blank is inert, so outputs stay the same). Reads the partner
  side's glue (fixed type): local. It would let a second blank type be one kind's own resource (blanks `k?k?k?` copy only
  sides `K`), so a diet could be a copied side rather than a stock. Not needed while stock parts give a private resource
  (`PAF`); weigh it if a stock proves too special (it is a prepared supply of a kind's own part types).
- (s) *Lysed material returns as blanks* (run 0621): the labelled drive `PAHB=2` as physics (a lysed triangle that comes
  free becomes a copy blank, replacing "returns to a fresh state of its type"). Not needed while the drive does it; it
  would make every death return raw material, and lysis stop recycling parts (the lysis demo's bud regrows from them).
- (r) *Copy error in contact copying* (run 0450): not needed yet; a labelled mutagen on free parts gives the same
  variants (RULES, Core changes). Open: whether the core or the environment should limit parts that bind their own
  kind (`g@` and `G@` on one part), which lock the material in the mutagen world.
- (o) the open relay's one-pass lag: **adopted** in run 1920 together with the joint (RULES Core changes); the
  lineage's false releases (`falseRel`) did not change and have another cause (trace one before any fix).
- (n) *Bud only after letting go* (run 1721): its oracle `BCGATE` was removed in run 0920 (git `20e9a88`). Organism
  lineage; frozen with it.
- (j) *Monomer mix* (run 0022) and (l) *a copy side with a glued anchor side* (run 0820): no design, no such type.
- Settled, keep: (f) the seed site `y` is copied while no bud sits on it (the pair relies on it). Not needed: (k).
  Done: (e), (i), (m) first step (lysis), (p) and (q) removed in run 1921. Nothing else in the core is unused (RULES,
  Core inventory).

**Open follow-ups (not priorities; take when a run's kind fits).**
- Core review: same-pass partner reads (zip, gap, release, fn) are allowed by convention (RULES, Locality audit);
  change only if a locality problem traces back to them.
- Speed (run 1721): a supply drive that keeps its stock outside the world, about 1.6x early in a run, changes
  outputs; decide it in a `build` that changes the setup.
- Suite time (run 0920): the frozen lineage's two checks are about three quarters of the suite's CPU time; a `harden`
  or `review-intent` run may cut them to fewer seeds or shorter worlds while the lineage stays frozen.
- Bigger cells and letter reuse (user, 2026-10-03; IDEAS): R 5 is the largest all-unique kind (46 letters); if a
  slice needs a larger cell, reuse letters inside sealed compartments.

Older demos: `copy` (chain copying, the founder held by its high end) and `ring` (a ring kit closes); each check in
`tri/check.js` names its seeds, steps, extra and env, and each demo's options are listed in the comment above it in
`tri/demos.js`. Commands of earlier setups are in their INNOVATIONS entries (options since removed: in git at the
commit INNOVATIONS' header or `tri/demos.js` names). Pictures go to `runs/NAME.png` with saved states; `TRI_NOPIC=1`
turns them off. `TRI_RESUME=runs/x/NAME_tNNN.json.gz` continues a demo world from a saved state; `TRI_PARAMS='{...}'`
overrides parameters. To show a change leaves outputs the same: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/a node tri/check.js` in a
worktree of main and `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/b ...` in the branch, then `diff -r`. Coverage hook: `COV_OUT=$PWD/runs/cov.jsonl
NODE_OPTIONS="-r ./tri/coverage.js" node tri/check.js` (one JSON line per demo world: marks present, rule events).

## Pitfalls learned
Read before designing a layout: docs/IDEAS.md, "Pitfalls learned (copy lineage)" (doorways, anchors, food sinks,
signals, rings, physics) and "Pitfalls from the casting lineage" (kits, pockets, doors, flaps; that lineage is
removed, its lessons stay).
