State on 2026-10-05 (after autorun run 20261005-1850, review-intent). Read AGENTS.md first (rules of work), then this file.
History: docs/INNOVATIONS.md (newest first), RULES (Core changes), the autorun log and git (earlier handoffs: NEXT.md
at each run's merge: run 1422's at `4f65d5c`, with the condensed Direction of run 0751; that Direction in full at `a2f3914`).

**The goal changed (user, 2026-10-05): complex evolution** (AGENTS.md, IDEAS); the organism is a direction. The
user approved the order in "Direction (user)" below during run 0321. Run 1850 keeps that order and changes the vehicle
it is tried on (below).

**In progress (autorun run 20261005-1921, core-review; branch `claude/core-review-1921`).** (1) `heldContact` removed
(done; 17 short worlds byte for byte as `main`). (2) Candidate (o): run 2051's oracle `LYFIX` is rejected (its -1 never
fades: two new bonds of opposite parity lock a silent body at "not heard", so its `&` never releases; `runs/o_wave.js`);
a fading variant (o') "a partner bonded since the last pass counts as open one bond away (1)" is on branch `claude/core-review-1921-o`
(worktree `/home/user/pw-o`), its full check with `CHECK_SAVE` running against the baseline `runs/base` (12 of 12).
(3) Candidate (q) next: remove the busy relay and refractory (`claude/core-review-1921-q`, worktree `/home/user/pw-q`). If this run ends,
rerun: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/x node tri/check.js > runs/check_x.txt` on each branch and `diff -r`.

**Handoff status (autorun run 20261005-1850, review-intent).** Direction check; no code change. Decision: Directions
1-3 move from the 47-type `budKit` lineage to the smallest budding kind the core already allows, **the pair** (2 cells,
2 types; designed, not demonstrated: IDEAS, "Sources in proportion to use"). The 47-type lineage is frozen, its checks
stay in the suite. `node tri/test.js` 38 tests pass; `tri/check.js` not rerun (no code change; run 1422: 12 of 12).
Nothing is running. Previous run (1422, explore): candidate (p) `heldContact` not yet (it closes the strand sink; the
blanks then pile up at stalled kit fronts; INNOVATIONS run 1422).

### Direction (review-intent run 20261005-1850)
The argument is in IDEAS ("Sources in proportion to use"); in short:
1. **The front sink is structural.** A part type is made where its free sides are exposed. In the 47-type kind that is
   growth fronts (type k exposed while the front waits for k+1) and, with open walls, only the outward half of a
   one-row ring (the inward half faces the lumen). Exposure differs from type to type, and with 47 unique types in one
   pool the least exposed type sets the rate. Runs 0721, 1051 and 1422 each closed one sink and found the next; no
   drive can make unequal sources equal.
2. **Design rule: every cell of a complete body exposes exactly one copyable side to the outside.** Each living body is
   then one source of each of its types, so types are made in the proportion buds use them, by symmetry, with no need
   signal (run 1422's option (c), met by geometry). The same rule is what heredity needs: a variant part is made in
   proportion to the bodies that carry it. A one-row ring with a lumen cannot meet it, nor a filled hexagon (its root's
   one outer side is the joint, spent after the split). A strip can: its end cells have two free sides.
3. **The pair:** root R `Y@&` `b@` `-` and second cell S `B@` `y` `-|` (side order chosen so a bud points away from its
   parent). A free R binds a body's seed site `y`; its open `b@` emits; a free S binds there; R hears nothing (openRange
   1 suffices: R is the emitter) and its `&` lets go. Rules used: `@` binding, contact copying, the open signal, `&`
   release. No new rule. R is exposed by its `-` side, S by `y` (while no bud sits on it).
4. **Why switch now** (AGENTS: mechanisms in isolation, then combined): on the pair none of the three interacting sinks
   (strands, fronts, lumen) exists, a generation should take thousands of steps instead of about 300 thousand, and a
   variant changes one of two types, so Directions 2 and 3 become measurable. If the pair cannot run on with labelled
   drives, no larger kind will; if it can, the rule and the drive rates carry over. Risk, stated: in template worlds the
   smallest fastest replicator usually wins; what could pay for a longer kind here (predation by `!` outer sides,
   protection, crowding) is Direction 3's question, and it is the research.
5. **Not taken:** run 1422's (b), parts made where they are next used, needs complementary contact copying (a core
   change) and turns growth into crystal growth. (a), few periodic types in a ring, helps only linearly and keeps the
   lumen; a periodic ring comes back later as a compartment on the evolution vehicle.
6. **Housekeeping found:** `budcycle` carries about 20 option variables, many from dead ends (`BCLK`, `BCH`, `BCHT`,
   `BCP`, `BCW`, `BCO`, `BCSV`, `BCGATE`): prune at the next cleanup, after the pair world has taken the drives it reuses.
   Since run 0751 the core grew by one rule (lysis: a capability) and one option (`heldContact`: none); fine.

**Priorities (each a slice; rotation index in brackets).**
1. [47 core-review] Remove `heldContact` (the vehicle has no strands; git keeps it at `4f65d5c`). Decide candidate (o)
   with `CHECK_SAVE`: adopt only if just `lysis` and `budcycle-lysis` change, and for the better.
2. [48 build] **The pair in isolation:** `structures.pairKit`, demo `pair`: one founder pair among copy blanks (about
   300, world about 30); measure bodies over time, generation depth, the R : S pool. Check: at least 3 of 4 worlds grow
   from one founder to 20 bodies. Look at the pictures first: does the bud point away, do buds jam beside parents?
3. [49 harden] Speed for long worlds of many small bodies; `budcycle` untouched.
4. [50 build] **Direction 1 on the pair:** labelled drives (free parts decay to blanks; a body hazard, lysis into parts,
   as `BCH` does); 4 long worlds; check: bodies still budding at the end in 3 of 4, many generations past the founder,
   pool R : S near 1.
5. [51 explore] **Direction 2:** heritable variation: contact copying now and then makes a variant (core change; case in
   RULES first: which sides may change; outer sides change behaviour without breaking assembly, joint sides are lethal;
   how a longer kind could arise).
6. [52 build] **Direction 3:** two kinds on one supply (the pair and a 3-cell strip): who wins, and why.
7. Frozen: the 47-type organism (feeding, (n), the front sink, lysis in the lineage); it returns as the complex end once
   the pair world runs on and varies.

**Rotation (autorun `projects/plywood/rotation.txt`): unchanged**; its mix (5 build, 3 explore, 1 harden, 1 cleanup, 1
review-intent, 1 core-review per 12) fits a new vehicle that needs mostly building. 47 core-review, 48 build, 49
harden, 50 build, 51 explore, 52 build, 53 cleanup, 54 build, 55 explore, 56 build, 57 explore, 58 review-intent.

### Direction (user, 2026-10-05, approved during run 20261005-0321): complex evolution first
The goal is complex evolution (AGENTS.md, IDEAS 2026-10-05); the organism that feeds its bud is a direction, not the
finish line. The user approved this order for the next slices:
1. **A world that runs indefinitely:** material returns to blanks under conservation, with a steady, labelled
   environment drive. On the 47-type kind: food stock spent (0321), blanks in leaked strands (0721), scavengers cannot
   track the population (1051), blanks at stalled fronts (1422). Next: on the pair (priority 4 above).
2. **The simplest heritable variation:** e.g. contact copying that now and then makes a different part type, the
   variant itself copied true (heredity with mutation in one rule; a core change: make the case in RULES first).
3. **A minimal competition test:** two variants on one food supply; does one win, and for a reason?

**Core-change candidates (for the next `core-review` or `explore`).**
- (p) *Contact copying follows "held"* (run 1051): the option `heldContact` (run 1422, not yet); remove (priority 1).
- (o) *The open relay hears "complete" too early after a new bond* (run 2051): a bonded triangle whose partners all had
  0 or -1 in the previous pass hears 0, so a triangle joined by a partner that was free a pass ago can conclude
  "complete". Proposed: a triangle that would hear 0 while a bonded partner had -1 hears -1. Locality: partners'
  previous values, as now. Evidence: traced in `lysis` (oracle `LYFIX=1`); 3-9 incomplete root releases per
  `budcycle` world (run 2221). The pair's release is not affected (R hears its own emission).
- (n) *Bud only after letting go* (run 1721): a seed site binds a root only while its triangle hears no open signal
  (oracle `BCGATE=1`). Organism lineage; frozen with it.
- (j) *Monomer mix* (run 0022) and (l) *a copy side with a glued anchor side* (run 0820): no design, no such type.
- Settled, keep: (f) the seed site `y` is copied while no bud sits on it (the pair relies on it). Not needed: (k).
  Done: (e), (i), (m) first step (lysis). Nothing else in the core is unused (RULES, Core inventory).

### Open follow-ups (not priorities; take when a run's kind fits)
- **Core review:** same-pass partner reads (zip, gap, release, fn) are allowed by convention (RULES, Locality audit);
  change only if a locality problem traces back to them. Coverage hook: `COV_OUT=$PWD/runs/cov.jsonl NODE_OPTIONS="-r
  ./tri/coverage.js" node tri/check.js` (one JSON line per demo world: marks present, rule events). To show a change
  leaves outputs the same: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/a node tri/check.js` before and after (another worktree), then
  `diff -r runs/a runs/b`.
- **Speed side note (run 1721):** a supply drive that keeps its stock outside the world, about 1.6x early in a run,
  changes outputs; decide it in a `build` that changes the setup.
- **Bigger cells and letter reuse** (user, 2026-10-03; IDEAS): R 5 is the largest all-unique kind (46 letters); if
  a slice needs a larger cell, reuse letters inside sealed compartments.

Older demos: `copy` (chain copying, the founder held by its high end) and `ring` (a ring kit closes); each check in
`tri/check.js` names its seeds, steps and extra. Commands of earlier setups are in their INNOVATIONS entries (options
since removed: in git at the commit each entry or `tri/demos.js` names). Pictures go to `runs/NAME.png` with saved
states; `TRI_NOPIC=1` turns them off. `TRI_RESUME=runs/x/NAME_tNNN.json.gz` continues a demo world from a saved state;
`TRI_PARAMS='{...}'` overrides parameters.

## Pitfalls learned
Read before designing a layout: docs/IDEAS.md, "Pitfalls learned (copy lineage)" (doorways, anchors, food sinks,
signals, rings, physics) and "Pitfalls from the casting lineage" (kits, pockets, doors, flaps; that lineage is
removed, its lessons stay).
