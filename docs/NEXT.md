State on 2026-10-06 (after autorun run 20261006-1322, explore). Read AGENTS.md first (rules of work), then this file.
History: docs/INNOVATIONS.md (newest first), RULES (Core changes), the autorun log, and git: each run's handoff is
this file at its merge (`git log -p docs/NEXT.md`; the review-intent Direction of run 0751 in full at `a2f3914`, the
pair Direction of run 1850 in full at `20e9a88`).

**Goal (user, 2026-10-05): complex evolution** (AGENTS.md, IDEAS); the organism that feeds its bud is a direction.
Since review-intent run 1850 the vehicle is **the pair** (2 cells, 2 types; IDEAS "Sources in proportion to use"): a
kind where every cell of a body exposes exactly one copyable side, so part types are made in the proportion buds use
them. The 47-type organism lineage is frozen; it returns as the complex end once the pair world varies and competes.

**Handoff status (autorun run 20261006-1322, explore).** Priority 7, heredity of combinations, settled by measurement
and a test; no rule change. Results (INNOVATIONS run 1322, IDEAS "Heredity of combinations is locality"):
1. Demo `pair` measures the parental share s (`PAPS=1`: a newborn's R, S, both copied from its parent body) and two-marker
   linkage (`PAV=link`), and takes a parasite S (`PAVK=parasite`, `B@-q`: copied at two sides, never buds), run 0621's
   selfish S (`PAVK=selfish`), a decay interval (`PADI`) and stirring (`PAMX`, labelled drive); default output byte for
   byte as main. `sim.js`'s observation log `copyLog` names each copy's template (no rule change).
2. Heredity is half parental: at h 0.6, decay every 100 steps, s is 0.39 for R and 0.44 for S, both parts 0.20; linkage
   between two markers is gone within about 35 generations. A lean pool raises s (decay every 10 steps, h 0.3: 0.58),
   a larger pool or stirring lowers it (0.25; 0.22). Fast decay at h 0.6 kills the world.
3. The parasite threshold (1 - s) k > 1 holds: k about 2; excluded at s 0.43 and 0.58, holds about half the bodies at
   0.25 (model 0.5), and the excluding world stirred lets it in and crashes (checks `pair-host`, `pair-host-c`,
   `pair-host-mx`, 4 of 4 each). Run 0621's selfish S (`B@-y!`) is lethal here, not selfish (gone in 2000 steps).
4. Analysis (parity): in a pair a fresh copy binds at once only beside its own template (so only one-type chains have
   parts made where they bind: why they win under the mutagen); parts made beside a different cell need four cells in
   an arc round a vertex. Designed, not built.
5. Full suite on the branch: 26 of 26 pass in 6404 s (about 107 minutes; imprint and ring 3 of 4 as before).
Nothing is running after the merge. Chart: `docs/pictures/parasite-share.png`, drawn from the `par:`
lines of the worlds in INNOVATIONS' commands (an ad hoc script, not kept).

**Next step (rotation 56, build): what pays for a longer kind**, first a second labelled supply only a longer kind can
use (IDEAS "One supply, one winner", (c)); the `duo` setting is the test bed. Report s (`PAPS=1`) in any selection test:
a cooperative combination resists a cheat only while s > 1 - 1/k.

## Direction and priorities

The user approved this order (run 0321): (1) a world that runs indefinitely under conservation with steady, labelled
drives; (2) the simplest heritable variation; (3) a minimal competition test (two variants on one supply: does one
win, and for a reason?). On the pair (each a slice; rotation index in brackets):
1. Done: the pair in isolation (run 2320, checks `pair`, `pair-c`); speed for pair worlds 1.8-2.1x (run 0021).
2. Done: (1) on the pair, hazard and decay drives (run 0251, check `pair-run`; 4 of 4 to 10^6 steps).
3. Done: (2) heritable variation and selection with a labelled mutagen, no core change (run 0450, `pair-sel`).
4. Done: a world that keeps evolving: deaths return blanks (`PAHB=2`; run 0621, `pair-flow`). By 500k a 3x world is
   one-type chains and rosettes whose variants keep replacing one another; no world grows more complex.
5. Done: cleanup (run 0920): budcycle's dead options pruned.
6. Done: (3) Direction 3, two kinds on one supply (run 1150, checks `duo`, `duo-inv`, `duo-inv-c`): the pair beats a
   3-cell strip from every start (lower R*); a trap for free parts on the extra cell does not pay.
7. Done: heredity of combinations by locality (run 1322, checks `pair-host`, `-c`, `-mx`): s about 0.44, a lean pool
   0.58; a parasite part is excluded once s > 1 - 1/k. By construction (s near 1): not in a pair (parity, IDEAS).
8. [56 build] what pays for a longer kind: first a second resource only it can use (IDEAS "One supply, one winner").
9. Frozen: the 47-type organism (feeding, candidate (n), the front sink, lysis in the lineage).

Rotation (autorun `projects/plywood/rotation.txt`), unchanged: 56 build, 57 explore, 58 review-intent, 59 core-review,
60 build.

**Core-change candidates (for the next `core-review` or `explore`).**
- (s) *Lysed material returns as blanks* (run 0621): the labelled drive `PAHB=2` as physics (a lysed triangle that comes
  free becomes a copy blank, replacing "returns to a fresh state of its type"). Not needed while the drive does it; it
  would make every death return raw material, and lysis stop recycling parts (the lysis demo's bud regrows from them).
- (r) *Copy error in contact copying* (run 0450): not needed yet; a labelled mutagen on free parts gives the same
  variants (RULES, Core changes). Open: whether the core or the environment should limit parts that bind their own
  kind (`g@` and `G@` on one part), which lock the material in the mutagen world.
- (o) the open relay's one-pass lag (false releases in the lineage): closed in run 1921 without a change. Seen again in
  a minimal kind (run 1150): a 3-cell strip's root lets go when its second cell binds (it stops emitting in the pass the
  new front starts) at openRange 1 or 2; openRange 3 covers it by the echo through the parent. A fix to weigh: binding
  sets the caught part's open signal at once (binding already sets both parties' state). Not needed while the range works.
- (n) *Bud only after letting go* (run 1721): its oracle `BCGATE` was removed in run 0920 (git `20e9a88`). Organism
  lineage; frozen with it.
- (j) *Monomer mix* (run 0022) and (l) *a copy side with a glued anchor side* (run 0820): no design, no such type.
- Settled, keep: (f) the seed site `y` is copied while no bud sits on it (the pair relies on it). Not needed: (k).
  Done: (e), (i), (m) first step (lysis), (p) and (q) removed in run 1921. Nothing else in the core is unused (RULES,
  Core inventory).

**Open follow-ups (not priorities; take when a run's kind fits).**
- Heredity by construction (run 1322, IDEAS parity): a kind of four or more cells in an arc round a vertex whose
  parts are copied beside the cell they join; or a compartment. An `explore` may design it; not needed for priority 8.
- Core review: same-pass partner reads (zip, gap, release, fn) are allowed by convention (RULES, Locality audit);
  change only if a locality problem traces back to them.
- Speed (run 1721): a supply drive that keeps its stock outside the world, about 1.6x early in a run, changes
  outputs; decide it in a `build` that changes the setup.
- Suite time (run 0920): the frozen lineage's two checks are about three quarters of the suite's CPU time; a `harden`
  or `review-intent` run may cut them to fewer seeds or shorter worlds while the lineage stays frozen.
- Bigger cells and letter reuse (user, 2026-10-03; IDEAS): R 5 is the largest all-unique kind (46 letters); if a
  slice needs a larger cell, reuse letters inside sealed compartments.

Older demos: `copy` (chain copying, the founder held by its high end) and `ring` (a ring kit closes); each check in
`tri/check.js` names its seeds, steps, extra and env, and each demo's options are listed in the comment above it in
`tri/demos.js`. Commands of earlier setups are in their INNOVATIONS entries (options since removed: in git at the
commit INNOVATIONS' header or `tri/demos.js` names). Pictures go to `runs/NAME.png` with saved states; `TRI_NOPIC=1`
turns them off. `TRI_RESUME=runs/x/NAME_tNNN.json.gz` continues a demo world from a saved state; `TRI_PARAMS='{...}'`
overrides parameters. To show a change leaves outputs the same: `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/a node tri/check.js` in a
worktree of main and `CHECK_SAVE=$PWD/runs/b ...` in the branch, then `diff -r`. Coverage hook: `COV_OUT=$PWD/runs/cov.jsonl
NODE_OPTIONS="-r ./tri/coverage.js" node tri/check.js` (one JSON line per demo world: marks present, rule events).

## Pitfalls learned
Read before designing a layout: docs/IDEAS.md, "Pitfalls learned (copy lineage)" (doorways, anchors, food sinks,
signals, rings, physics) and "Pitfalls from the casting lineage" (kits, pockets, doors, flaps; that lineage is
removed, its lessons stay).
